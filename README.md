## Overview

This is my submission for the second Frontend Mentor project. Leveraging my basic skills in HTML and CSS, and with some online resources, I successfully assembled this project. I avoided using any external design tools, concentrating exclusively on pure HTML and CSS.

## My process

Initially, I went through the given resources for creating the blog preview card and studied examples of the finished product, noting the styling details. After that, I structured the HTML, ensuring I comprehended the components from the examples, and decided to organize the content within a container. I then concentrated on styling using CSS properties instead of external tools, adhering to the "style-guide" parameters. Finally, I completed the project by making the required responsive adjustments for mobile display, which was a new experience for me.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex


### What I learned

Unlike the previous QR code project, which required no mobile design ratio adjustments, this project allowed me to explore and understand responsive CSS styling. I used Media Queries to create parameters that adapt to various aspect ratios across different devices, gaining valuable experience in responsive design.

### Continued development

While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.
